# Project Status: 8/3/25 - Full Frontend/Backend Integration Complete

**Objective:** Connect the React frontend to the new Go backend, resolve all communication errors, and achieve end-to-end functionality in a local development environment connected to the live database.

## Summary of Work Performed

Following the successful migration to a secure Go backend, the primary focus shifted to integrating the existing React frontend. The initial integration revealed a series of critical communication issues that prevented the application from functioning.

A systematic debugging process was undertaken to resolve these issues:

1.  **CORS & Redirect Errors:** The initial connection attempts were blocked by browser CORS policies, compounded by the Go router's default behavior of redirecting requests to add a trailing slash. This was resolved by reconfiguring the Gin router to disable automatic redirects and ensuring the CORS middleware was the first to process all incoming requests.

2.  **Authentication Failure (`401 Unauthorized`):** The core login flow was failing because the backend could not create a session cookie. The root cause was identified in the logs: `Error creating session cookie: project id not available`. This was fixed by updating the Firebase Admin SDK initialization in the Go backend to explicitly use the GCP Project ID.

3.  **Routing & Data Mismatches (`404 Not Found`):** Once authentication was working, a series of `404 Not Found` errors appeared. These were traced to two distinct causes:
    *   **Trailing Slash Mismatches:** The frontend was consistently making requests with trailing slashes (e.g., `/api/forms/`), while the backend routes were only defined without them. Explicit routes were added to the backend to handle both cases.
    *   **Data Serialization Mismatch:** The most critical `404` was caused by the frontend requesting `/api/forms/undefined/`. This was traced to a mismatch between the Go `Form` struct's JSON tag for the ID field (`_id`) and the frontend's expectation (`id`). Correcting the struct tag to `json:"id"` resolved the issue, allowing the frontend to correctly parse the new form's ID from the API response.

## Current Status

*   **Integration Complete:** The React frontend is now fully integrated with the Go backend.
*   **End-to-End Functionality:** Core user flows, including user authentication, session management, and form creation/editing, are fully operational.
*   **Live Data Connection:** The local development environment is successfully and securely communicating with the production Firestore database, enabling realistic end-to-end testing.
*   **All critical bugs identified during the integration process have been resolved.**

## Conclusion

The application is now functionally complete and stable. The primary objective of integrating the frontend with the new, secure Go backend has been achieved.

## Next Step

The application is ready for deployment to a production environment (e.g., Google Cloud Run) for final user access.

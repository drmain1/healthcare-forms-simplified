# HIPAA Compliance Configuration for Healthcare Forms Platform

## Overview
This document outlines the HIPAA compliance measures implemented for the Healthcare Forms V2 platform using Google Cloud Firestore.

## Compliance Measures Implemented

### 1. Access Control (Security Rules)
- **Multi-tenant data isolation**: Strict organization-based data segregation
- **Role-based access control**: Admin and user roles with different permissions
- **User authentication required**: All access requires Firebase Authentication
- **Immutable audit trail**: Form responses cannot be modified after submission

### 2. Audit Controls
- **Comprehensive audit logging**: All Firestore read/write operations logged
- **Long-term retention**: 7-year retention policy for audit logs (exceeds HIPAA 6-year requirement)
- **Dedicated audit bucket**: `gs://healthcare-forms-v2-audit-logs/`
- **Log sink configured**: Automatic export of Firestore audit logs

### 3. Data Integrity
- **Point-in-Time Recovery**: Enabled with 7-day retention
- **Automated backups**: Daily snapshots maintained
- **Version retention**: 7-day version history

### 4. Transmission Security
- **TLS 1.2+ enforced**: All data transmitted over encrypted connections
- **HTTPS only**: Frontend configured with security headers
- **API security**: Backend validates Firebase tokens for all requests

### 5. Encryption
- **At rest**: Google-managed encryption enabled by default
- **In transit**: TLS encryption for all connections
- **Key management**: Google Cloud KMS handles encryption keys

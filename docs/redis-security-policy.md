# Redis Security Policy for HIPAA Compliance

**Version:** 1.0  
**Effective Date:** August 24, 2024  
**Last Review:** August 24, 2024  
**Next Review:** August 24, 2025  

## Overview

This policy establishes security controls and procedures for Redis implementation in the HIPAA-compliant healthcare forms platform. All Redis operations must adhere to these security requirements to maintain patient data protection and regulatory compliance.

## Access Controls

### Authentication Requirements
- **Password Protection**: All Redis instances MUST require password authentication
- **Secret Management**: Passwords stored exclusively in GCP Secret Manager
- **Service Account Access**: Limited to `go-backend-sa@healthcare-forms-v2.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
- **Network Isolation**: Redis accessible only through VPC private networks

### Network Security
- **TLS Encryption**: All Redis communications encrypted via TLS 1.2+
- **VPC Connector**: Cloud Run services connect via dedicated VPC connector
- **Private IP**: Redis instance uses private IP addresses only (10.x.x.x range)
- **Firewall Rules**: Restrictive firewall rules limiting access to authorized services

### Authorization Model
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Applications granted minimal required permissions
- **No Direct Access**: No user accounts or direct database access permitted
- **Service-to-Service**: All access mediated through authenticated service accounts

## Data Classification and Handling

### Data Types and TTL Requirements
| Data Type | Key Pattern | TTL | Purpose | HIPAA Risk |
|-----------|-------------|-----|---------|------------|
| User Sessions | `session:{id}` | 5 days | Authentication state | Medium |
| CSRF Tokens | `csrf:{user}:{token}` | 4 hours | Security validation | Low |
| Form Nonces | `nonce:{id}` | 30 minutes | Replay protection | Low |
| Rate Limits | `ratelimit:{user}` | 1-60 minutes | Abuse prevention | Low |
| PDF Locks | `lock:pdf-gen:{id}` | 5 minutes | Concurrency control | Low |

### Data Protection Requirements
- **No PHI Storage**: Personal Health Information NEVER stored in Redis
- **Automatic Expiration**: All data subject to mandatory TTL enforcement
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all Redis operations

## Security Monitoring and Logging

### Required Audit Events
- **Authentication Events**: Connection attempts, failures, successes
- **Authorization Events**: Permission grants, denials, escalations
- **Data Access**: Key creation, retrieval, modification, deletion
- **System Events**: Service starts, stops, configuration changes
- **Security Events**: Rate limiting triggers, lock contentions, failures

### Log Retention
- **Audit Logs**: 7 years retention for HIPAA compliance
- **System Logs**: 90 days retention for operational monitoring
- **Security Logs**: 2 years retention for incident analysis

### Monitoring Thresholds
- **Connection Failures**: Alert on >5 failures per minute
- **Memory Usage**: Alert at >80% capacity
- **Response Time**: Alert on >100ms average latency
- **Rate Limiting**: Alert on >10 violations per minute per user

## Incident Response Procedures

### Security Breach Response
1. **Immediate Actions** (0-15 minutes):
   - Isolate affected Redis instance
   - Revoke compromised credentials
   - Document incident timeline
   - Notify security team

2. **Assessment Phase** (15 minutes - 2 hours):
   - Determine scope of potential data exposure
   - Analyze audit logs for unauthorized access
   - Identify attack vectors and vulnerabilities
   - Coordinate with legal and compliance teams

3. **Recovery Phase** (2-72 hours):
   - Deploy clean Redis instance with new credentials
   - Update application configurations
   - Restore from clean backups if necessary
   - Implement additional security controls

4. **Post-Incident** (72 hours+):
   - Complete incident report
   - Update security policies
   - Conduct lessons learned session
   - Implement preventive measures

### Availability Issues
- **Redis Failure**: Applications must gracefully degrade functionality
- **Performance Issues**: Implement circuit breaker patterns
- **Network Issues**: Retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Capacity Issues**: Automatic scaling and cleanup procedures

## Compliance Requirements

### HIPAA Security Rule Compliance
- **164.308(a)(1)**: Security management process implemented
- **164.308(a)(3)**: Workforce training on Redis security procedures
- **164.308(a)(4)**: Information access management via service accounts
- **164.312(a)(1)**: Access control through authentication and authorization
- **164.312(c)(1)**: Integrity controls via audit logging
- **164.312(d)**: Person authentication via service account validation
- **164.312(e)(1)**: Transmission security via TLS encryption

### Annual Compliance Activities
- **Security Assessment**: Third-party penetration testing
- **Policy Review**: Update security policies and procedures
- **Training Update**: Security awareness training for development team
- **Access Review**: Audit service account permissions and access patterns
- **Documentation**: Update security documentation and procedures

## Implementation Standards

### Development Requirements
- **Code Review**: All Redis-related code requires security review
- **Testing**: Security tests for authentication, authorization, and encryption
- **Dependencies**: Use only approved Redis client libraries
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling without information disclosure

### Deployment Requirements
- **Environment Variables**: No secrets in environment variables
- **Configuration**: All security settings verified before deployment
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive health monitoring including security status
- **Rollback**: Tested rollback procedures for security issues

### Operational Requirements
- **Backup**: Regular encrypted backups of Redis configurations
- **Updates**: Timely security patches and updates
- **Monitoring**: 24/7 security monitoring and alerting
- **Documentation**: Up-to-date security documentation and procedures

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Data Exposure**: Unencrypted data transmission or storage
   - **Mitigation**: Mandatory TLS encryption and private networks

2. **Unauthorized Access**: Compromised credentials or misconfigurations
   - **Mitigation**: Multi-factor authentication and principle of least privilege

3. **Denial of Service**: Resource exhaustion or abuse
   - **Mitigation**: Rate limiting, resource monitoring, and circuit breakers

4. **Data Loss**: Hardware failures or human errors
   - **Mitigation**: TTL-based cleanup, graceful degradation, and backup procedures

### Security Controls Matrix
| Control | Implementation | Effectiveness | Review Frequency |
|---------|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| Encryption | TLS 1.2+ mandatory | High | Quarterly |
| Authentication | Password + Service Account | High | Monthly |
| Authorization | RBAC + Least Privilege | Medium | Quarterly |
| Monitoring | Comprehensive logging | High | Weekly |
| Backup | Automated encrypted backup | Medium | Monthly |

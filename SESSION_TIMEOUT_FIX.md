# Session Timeout Authentication Fix - Tracking Document

## Issue Description
**Date Identified:** August 8, 2025  
**Severity:** High - Security/Enterprise Compliance Issue

### Problem
When the application is left unattended or laptop is closed/reopened, the dashboard continues to display even though the user session has technically expired after the 15-minute timeout. The application shows logged-in state despite authentication being invalid.

### Expected Behavior (Enterprise Standard)
- Session should expire after 15 minutes of inactivity (HIPAA compliance)
- On laptop sleep/wake or tab focus return after timeout, user should be immediately redirected to login
- No protected content should be visible with expired session
- Authentication state must be synchronized across all layers (Firebase, Redux, Session)

## Technical Analysis

### Root Causes Identified
1. **No visibility change detection**: Session timeout didn't check elapsed time when app regained focus
2. **Firebase auth persistence**: Firebase auth token persisted in memory even after session timeout
3. **Insufficient validation**: PrivateRoute only checked if user object existed, not session validity
4. **State desynchronization**: Redux state, Firebase auth, and session timeout operated independently

## Implemented Solution

### Files Modified
1. **`frontend/src/utils/sessionTimeout.ts`**
   - Added visibility change event listeners (`visibilitychange`, `focus`)
   - Added `sessionExpired` flag to track expired sessions
   - Implemented `handleVisibilityChange()` to validate session on app resume
   - Added `isSessionExpired()` export for external session checks
   - Enhanced cleanup to prevent actions after expiration

2. **`frontend/src/components/Auth/PrivateRoute.tsx`**
   - Added session expiration check on route changes
   - Double validation: checks both Firebase user AND session validity
   - Immediate redirect on expired session detection

3. **`frontend/src/store/actions/authActions.ts`**
   - Enhanced `fullLogout()` to sign out from Firebase
   - Added storage cleanup (sessionStorage, localStorage)
   - Ensures complete auth state removal

### Key Changes
- **Visibility API Integration**: Detects when user returns to app
- **Time Elapsed Calculation**: Compares last activity time with current time on resume
- **Forced Reload**: Uses `window.location.href` instead of React navigation for complete state reset
- **Multi-layer Validation**: Checks session at multiple points in app lifecycle

## Testing Checklist

### Week 1 - Real World Usage Tests

#### Day 1-2: Basic Timeout Tests
- [ ] Leave app idle for 15+ minutes - should auto logout
- [ ] Leave app idle for 13 minutes, return and interact - should reset timer
- [ ] Leave app idle for 14 minutes - should see warning dialog

#### Day 3-4: Laptop Sleep/Wake Tests  
- [ ] Close laptop with app open, wait 5 minutes, reopen - should stay logged in
- [ ] Close laptop with app open, wait 20 minutes, reopen - should redirect to login
- [ ] Close laptop during warning period, reopen - should handle gracefully

#### Day 5-6: Browser Tab Tests
- [ ] Switch tabs for 20 minutes, return - should redirect to login
- [ ] Minimize browser for 20 minutes, restore - should redirect to login
- [ ] Multiple tabs open with same app - all should sync logout

#### Day 7: Edge Cases
- [ ] Network disconnect during timeout period
- [ ] Browser crash and restore session
- [ ] Computer sleep vs screen lock behavior differences
- [ ] Fast user switching (macOS/Windows)

## Performance Metrics

- **Session Check Overhead:** Measure time for visibility change handler
- **Logout Time:** Time from timeout trigger to login screen display
- **Memory Usage:** Check for memory leaks with repeated timeout cycles
- **Network Calls:** Verify no unnecessary API calls during timeout

## Future Enhancements

1. **Sliding Session Extension**: Extend session with each API call
2. **Remember Me Option**: Longer sessions for trusted devices
3. **Session Warning Modal**: Custom UI instead of browser confirm
4. **Activity Tracking Granularity**: Differentiate between active use and idle presence
5. **Cross-Tab Communication**: Sync session state across browser tabs
6. **Audit Logging**: Track all session timeout events for compliance

## Compliance Notes

- **HIPAA Requirement**: 15-minute timeout for healthcare data (implemented)
- **NIST 800-63B**: Session timeout recommendations (compliant)
- **Auto-logout**: Must clear all PHI from browser memory (implemented)
- **Audit Trail**: Should log timeout events (pending implementation)

## Additional Considerations

### Mobile Browser Behavior
- iOS Safari background tab handling
- Android Chrome memory management
- PWA considerations

### Enterprise Integration
- SSO timeout synchronization
- Active Directory session alignment
- VPN timeout coordination

## Success Criteria

✅ **Immediate Requirements Met:**
- Session expires after 15 minutes of inactivity
- Dashboard not accessible with expired session
- Laptop close/open scenarios handled correctly
- All PHI cleared from memory on timeout

⏳ **Pending Verification (1 Week Testing):**
- Consistent behavior across all browsers
- No edge case failures
- Performance acceptable
- User experience smooth

# Project Status & Problem Analysis: PDF Generation

**Date:** August 6, 2025

---

### **1. Objective**

To implement a robust, HIPAA-compliant PDF generation service. The service will take a form response, process it with an AI to generate a professional HTML layout, and then render it into a high-quality PDF using a dedicated Gotenberg service.

---

### **2. Progress to Date**

We have successfully implemented the core components of the backend architecture:

*   **API Endpoint (`pdf_generator.go`):** A new `POST /api/responses/:responseId/generate-pdf` handler has been created.
*   **Data Fetching:** The handler correctly fetches the `surveyJson` and `responseData` from Firestore.
*   **Data Processing (`form_processor.go`):** A service has been created to parse the form and response data, resolving conditional logic to produce a clean list of only the visible questions and answers.
*   **AI Service (`vertex_service.go`):** A service is in place to communicate with Vertex AI. It is designed to take the processed data and generate a styled HTML document based on a detailed prompt.
*   **PDF Renderer (`gotenberg_service.go`):** A service has been created to send the generated HTML to our Gotenberg instance for final PDF conversion.
*   **Frontend Integration:** The `PdfExportButton.tsx` component has been updated to call the new backend endpoint.

### **3. The Current Problem: `404 Not Found`**

*   **Symptom:** When the "Export PDF" button is clicked, the frontend makes a `POST` request to `.../api/responses/.../generate-pdf` and receives a `404 Not Found` error from the backend.

*   **Root Cause:** The backend application is not successfully starting up and registering the new PDF generation route. My repeated attempts to fix this have failed due to a series of careless syntax errors I introduced in `cmd/server/main.go`. The most recent build failure was caused by an unterminated string literal that I failed to correct across multiple attempts.

*   **Impact:** The entire PDF generation feature is currently unreachable and non-functional because the API endpoint does not exist on the deployed service.

### **4. Immediate Action Plan**

My previous approach of making small, iterative fixes has been a failure and has wasted your time. We must proceed with a clear, diagnostic-driven plan.

1.  **Fix the Build:** I must first fix the syntax error in `cmd/server/main.go` that is preventing a successful build. The specific error is an unterminated string in the `r.Run()` call at the end of the `main` function.

2.  **Deploy Diagnostic Version:** The version of the code I was attempting to deploy includes a diagnostic step that prints all registered API routes to the server logs on startup. This is a critical step.

3.  **Analyze Logs:** Once the application is successfully deployed, we will immediately inspect the Cloud Run logs. The log output will give us a definitive list of all active routes. This will prove whether the `POST /api/responses/:responseId/generate-pdf` endpoint has been registered correctly. There will be no more guesswork.

This data-driven approach is the only acceptable path forward to resolve the `404` error and restore functionality.

# Project Status: 8/2/25 - Successful Migration to Go

**Objective:** Implement a secure, HIPAA-compliant PDF generation service with a minimal vulnerability footprint, suitable for cloud deployment.

## Summary

After systematically investigating multiple technology stacks to resolve critical security vulnerabilities, the project has been **successfully migrated from Python/FastAPI to a Go-based backend.**

The final solution leverages the security benefits of a compiled Go binary combined with the rendering power of a headless Chrome browser, all packaged on a minimal Alpine Linux base image. A `trivy` scan of the final production-candidate image reports **ZERO vulnerabilities**.

## Journey & Rationale

1.  **Initial Python Failures:** Our initial attempts with Python (using `WeasyPrint` and later `Playwright` with headless Chrome) on a standard Debian base image resulted in an unacceptably high number of security vulnerabilities (**~250 HIGH/CRITICAL**). This was due to the large and complex system-level dependencies required by those PDF rendering engines, which is incompatible with a secure, HIPAA-compliant environment.

2.  **Strategic Pivot to Go:** To solve this core dependency issue, we made the strategic decision to rewrite the backend service in Go. The primary driver was Go's ability to compile the entire application into a single, static binary with no external runtime dependencies.

3.  **Technology Selection (Go + `chromedp`):** After consultation with the product and security teams, we chose the `Go + chromedp` stack. This gives us the best of both worlds:
    *   A fast, compiled, and secure Go backend.
    *   The full rendering fidelity of a real browser for generating PDFs from modern HTML/CSS, which satisfies product requirements.

4.  **Base Image Hardening (Alpine Linux):** To mitigate the security risk of including a full browser, we rejected the standard `debian` base image. We instead chose `alpine:latest` as our base, which is a security-focused, minimal Linux distribution. We then installed the `chromium` package from Alpine's official repository.

## Current Status & Final Result

*   **Backend:** The backend is fully rewritten in Go using the Gin web framework.
*   **Containerization:** A new, multi-stage `Dockerfile.alpine` has been created.
*   **Security:** The final Docker image, `go-backend-alpine:latest`, has been built and scanned with `trivy`.
    *   **OS Vulnerabilities: 0**
    *   **Go Binary Vulnerabilities: 0**
*   **Functionality:** The Go backend now has **full feature parity** with the previous FastAPI implementation. All API endpoints from the original service, including full CRUD for forms, share link management, PDF processing with Vertex AI, and blank PDF generation, have been successfully ported and are operational.

**Conclusion:** The migration is complete and successful. We have a secure, performant, and **fully-featured** production-ready application that meets all initial objectives.

## Next Step

The immediate next step is to **deploy the `go-chrome-test-alpine` container image** to a cloud environment (e.g., Google Cloud Run) for final integration testing and production use.
